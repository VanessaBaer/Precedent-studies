# 03 â€“ Improvements (Kubernetes-Centric Enhancements)

Enhancements applied:
- Added `ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 300`
- Defined CPU/memory requests and limits
- Added `backoffLimit: 2`
- Changed `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`
- Improved annotations and comments

**Why These Matter**
- TTL cleans up Jobs after completion
- Resource limits prevent cluster exhaustion
- Backoff limits reduce unnecessary retries
- Improved scheduling ensures better resilience
