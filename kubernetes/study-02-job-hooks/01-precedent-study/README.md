# 01 â€“ Baseline Precedent Study

This folder contains the **original Helm-templated Kubernetes Jobs** that run before installation (`pre-install`) and after deletion (`post-delete`).

**Focus:** Kubernetes Job mechanics and how Helmâ€™s hook annotations trigger them.

**What to Observe:**
- The `batch/v1` Job controller behavior.
- `env`, `envFrom`, and Secret handling.
- Hook annotations and lifecycle order.
